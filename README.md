# Health Monitor Android Application

## Project Description
The main goal of this project is to develop an Android-based health application that monitors usersâ€™ health metrics. The application is designed with a tabbed layout, providing users with an intuitive interface to manage their health data and access valuable health information.

## Key Features

### Personal Information Tab
- A signup/information collection page where users can create a profile.
- Fields to collect and display: Name, Age, Height, and Weight.
- Users can update this information at any time.

### Health Topics Tab
- A list view of links to common health topics (e.g., diet, diseases).
- Each link opens in a detailed view for more information.
- At least 5 different health-related links are provided.

### Daily Health Check Tab
- Allows users to enter daily health metrics: Blood pressure, Blood sugar level, and Calorie intake.
- Data is stored day-wise and trends (weekly, monthly, yearly) are presented.
- Users can either pick a date from the system or manually add it.

### Health Suggestions Tab
- Displays category-wise health improvement suggestions based on user-entered data.
- Offers specific advice if the blood pressure or blood sugar levels are not within the normal range, or if calorie intake is inconsistent.
